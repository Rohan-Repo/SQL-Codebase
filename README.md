# SQL-Demo-Files : DB-Wise-Codebase

A structured collection of SQL scripts organized by major relational database systems — MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite — designed for developers, database administrators, and learners to explore practical SQL queries and database management tasks.

## Overview

This folder contains SQL scripts curated and organized by database platform, serving as a comprehensive resource for:

- Creating and managing schemas, tables, and indexes
- Writing queries to manipulate and fetch data
- Designing stored procedures, triggers, and functions
- Performance tuning and optimization examples
- Database-specific best practices and examples

Each subfolder targets one database platform, with syntax and features tailored accordingly.
