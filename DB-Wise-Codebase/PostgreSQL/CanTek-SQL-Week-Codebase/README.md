# CanTek-SQL-Week
<h3> SQL Assignments for CanTek's Data Analysis Cohort </h3>

We Analysed the data for the <b> [DVD Rental DB](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) </b>

The SQL Queries and Scripts have been added with increasing order of Complexity. 

We have made use of <b> basic </b> SQL Constructs like <b> Table Joins, GroupBy and OrderBy, Union, Limit </b> etc.

One Query also takes into picture the <b> CASE-WHEN </b> struct

In addition to that, we have also used some <b> Advanced </b> SQL Concepts like <b> Common Table Expressions OR String Aggregation Functions like STRING_AGG() and STRING_TO_ARRAY() </b>.
